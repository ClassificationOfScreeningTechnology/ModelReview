# ClassificationOfScreeningTechnology

This repository contains the resources developed for the thesis project "Classification of Screening Technology." 
The project focuses on developing a computer vision model to classify and analyze screening technologies based on visual criteria. 
The repository is structured into key components, including Jupyter notebooks for model development, scripts for dataset preparation and analysis, and a containerized FastAPI server for serving the model.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Notebooks**
- Contains Jupyter notebooks used for:
  - Prototyping and experimenting with different computer vision architecture.
  - Evaluating model performance.

### 2. **Scripts**
- Scripts in directories: Analiza and dataset_scripts:
    -  dataset_scripts for:
        - Preparing dataset, including splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
    - Analiza for:
        - Analysis and exploration of dataset characteristics.

### 3. **Model Serving**
- A containerized FastAPI server that:
  - Hosts the trained computer vision model.
  - Includes endpoint for predictions.
